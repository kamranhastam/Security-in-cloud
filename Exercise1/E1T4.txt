Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security

#poor security 1
InstanceRolePolicy-C3 is not followed by Principle of Least Privilege. 
base on this diagram it's better to limit access to specific S3 bucket and not to all resources.

#poor security 2
Security group WebAppSG is not following standard security compliance and it's open to all CIDR 0.0.0.0/0 for all inbound traffic (http, ssh, TCP),
if anyone can breach to the network then attacker can get all information.
