# Describe GuardDuty findings that were detected related to the brute force attack
I run the attack script and I was checking for almost 3 hours but gaurd duty didn't detect anything related to brute force attack,
it was setup base on instruction everything and I attack on public DNS ip address of webserver and guard duty in the same region, 
I provided guardduty,attack terminal and vpcflow log snapshots base on mentor help guidance for consideration. 

but it should find UnauthorizedAccess:EC2/SSHBruteForce if it works properly
# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information.
Guard Duty collect information from several source like VPC Flow Logs,CloudTrail, DNS logs and CloudWatch and performs analyses against that data. 
In the case of the brute force attack, it detected information about the network traffic from the VPC Flow Logs and AWS CloudTrail
